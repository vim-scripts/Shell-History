If you have previously typed a complicated command into your shell and then want to use it within a shell script this will make it easier to grab

just start typing a fragment of the command and hit control b

Note: .bash_history will normally only be written to when you exit a shell

You may want to tweak your history settings to gain best possible performance

This was just a personal  experiment at vim scripting, please send improvements/suggestions.
